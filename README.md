# exifNeatHTML
Dynamically converts Exiftool generated HTML into more dynamic one.

For now it's Windows only. All you need is to get exiftool (https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/), put the executable (as exiftool.exe) into the system path or exifNeatHTML path and that all.
 
It's not perfect, as change in HTML generated by the Exiftool would destroy results, but it's rather a proof of concept. The result doesn't contain any credits (except Exiftool info) and the license of the result is something between MIT (for jQuery) and IDon'tCare for my part.

The generated files can be easily shared, but it's designed mostly for home use, for people who prefer HTML results, instead console/text files/classic GUI applications.

Features
========
* Generates proper HTML (Exiftool one is just a `<table>` element) and add classes/ids for proper cells/headers
* Adds navigational menu, sections are collapsible and easier to read
* Generated HTML is stand-alone - it creates temporary directory with all you need, so you can upload and share it
* With exifNeatHTML it's possible to easily redesign result - it add classes, so you don't need to use some long pseudoclasses
* With jQuery included, one can change behaviour without much hassle
* Logging of errors with some trickish-brainfuckish Windows Batch functions
* It's designed both for simple changing look and behavior, but mostly it's for novices.

Usage
=====
0. Get Exiftool binary for Windows (shame if you don't have it already!), rename it to exiftool.exe and put it into the system path or into directory where you'd gonna download exifNeatHTML
1. Just run the exifNeatHTML.bat file with the image file name as parameter - in other words you can use it from console, but you can also drag image and drop onto bat file or put shortcut into _Send to_ Windows menu (https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/customize-the-windows-vista-send-to-menu/)
2. After some processing (about an hour with 386 PC or half a second with modern one) it will put all needed files into temporary directory and display HTML in your default browser. To share it, just look at adress bar and you'd know where it's located.
3. If something would go wrong, there will be exifNeatHTML.log file in the directory of the script.

Files
=====
1. exifNeatHTML.bat - main script, and then three files which are copied to the result directory:
2. exifInfo.js - script that makes DHTML (who still remembers this abbreviation?) from HTML
3. exifInfo.css - hmm, CSS? Yeah.
4. exifInfo.jQuery.js - minimized jQuery 3.x, so you can use generated files offline

To do
=====
* Automatically download Exiftool
* Auto-"installer" for send-to menu
* Ability to create a whole bunch of HTML files, e.g. for whole directory

Thanks
======
* Olga - as it's made for her
* Phil Harvey - in my opinion his application has changed the world of digital photography - it made easy things which were hard or impossible before. Of course one may disagree, but you'd be shocked how many applications are using Exiftool inside. And that's obvious, as it's just the only and the best in its class. Also thanks for being good person. When there are more difficut cases, he's always there to explain, help, think out of the box and see potential problems with processing photos. 
* Other people from Exiftool forum - they are very helpful persons as well and thanks to them and Phil I can make better photos, because Exiftool simplify things so much, I have more time for taking photos and processing them.
